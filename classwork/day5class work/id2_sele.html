<p>Below are a series of 
poorly constructed paragraphs and possible solutions.
 Put yourself in the place of a teacher. Criticise the str
 ucture of each paragraph and suggest how it might be impr
 oved. Be very critical about how the paragraph is constru
 cted and how well the ideas flow. There are quite a few 
 examples to have a go at because being critical of the 
 work of others is difficult but gets easier the more you
 practice.
